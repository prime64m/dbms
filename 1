5a. Find all the customers who have atleast two accounts at the main branch

select distinct(customer_name), count(*) 
from account a, depositor d 
where  a.accno=d.accno and 
 d.accno in (select accno from account where branch_name='jaynagar') 
group by d.customer_name having count(*)>=2;




5b. Find all the customers who have an account at all the branches located in a specified city.

select d.customer_name from 
account a, depositor d, branch b where 
b.branch_name=a.branch_name 
and 
a.accno=d.accno 
and 
b.branch_city='bangalore' 
group by customer_name having 
count(distinct b.branch_name) = (select count(branch_name) from branch where branch_city='bangalore');




5c. Demonstrate how you delete all account tuples at every branch located in a specified city

delete from account 
where branch_name 
in (select branch_name from branch where branch_city='delhi' and accno <> 0);
